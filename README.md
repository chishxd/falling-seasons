## Introduction

This project is my answer to the question: What does "Fall" mean when you don't have falling leaves or pumpkin carvings? I never celebrated Halloween, It was never collecting leaves for me. So I decided to redefine how Fall is celebrated here...

As someone from India, our 'Fall' is a season of incredible transition... from the final days of the heavy monsoon to the vibrant, radiant celebrations of Ganeshotsav, Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali.

These festivals are not just celebrations to welcome new season, but to gather with your loved ones across the world... They are celebrations for the **victory of justice over evil**

**Falling Seasons** is an animated, scrollable story that celebrates this unique seasonal shift. It's a visual journey through the colors, lights, and festivals that define Autumn for us.

I hope my website will help spread the beauty of my country's culture to the people participating in Siege by Hackclub. Together, we can reimagine a new phase of Fall, one that celebrates diversity and the unique ways this season is experienced around the world.
